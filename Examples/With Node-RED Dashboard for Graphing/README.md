# Examples with Node-RED Dashboard

Examples in this folder have an external dependency on the chart function of the Node-RED Dashboard. To use these examples you must first install that dependency through the palette manager and then import this flow. View the chart output by accessing the Node-RED dashboard via *ip-address:port/ui*. For example, on my dev machine I access the dashboard by going to *localhost:1880/ui* or *127.0.0.1:1880/ui*.
